To do :
- add documentation to :
    - preprocessing
    - storm
    - utils
    - vgam_loader
- create a template for the experiment in the form of a readable text file, and modify the function accordingly. Eventually cmodify create_experiment_file
- double check test and script to avoid mismatch between names.
- go through nn_train to avoid useless functions
